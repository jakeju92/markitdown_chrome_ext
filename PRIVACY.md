This Privacy Policy explains how the MarkItDown Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how your data is used.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Collect

The MarkItDown Chrome Extension collects and processes the following types of data:

1. **Website Content**: When you use the extension to convert a webpage to markdown, we temporarily process the content of the current webpage you are viewing.

   - OpenAI API keys
   - OpenAI base URLs
   - Ollama endpoint URLs
   - Model preferences

3. **User Preferences**: Settings related to your preferred AI provider and summary prompt templates.

### How We Use Your Data

All data collected is used exclusively for the following purposes:

1. **Website Content**: Processed solely to convert HTML to markdown format and to generate AI-powered summaries when requested.

2. **API Credentials**: Used only to authenticate with the respective AI services (OpenAI or Ollama) for generating summaries.

3. **User Preferences**: Used to provide a personalized experience by remembering your settings between sessions.

## Data Storage

- Website content is processed in memory and is not persistently stored by the extension

## Data Sharing

### Third-Party Services

The extension may send data to third-party services only in the following circumstances:
